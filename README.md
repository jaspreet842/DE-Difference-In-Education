Making a platform that can make a difference in the field of online education.
Name of the project:  DE -(Diffrence in Education)

Title: Caption/Description - A platform that can help students in learning ,resolving the doubts,practicing and analyzing themselves. 
   	On which test can be organize.

Technologies/Installations: Html/Html5 , CSS/CSS3 , Mongodb ,Javascript , Javascript frameworks(Express.js , Node.js ) ,Pug ,Javascript libraries(Mongoose,passport,bycryptjs)

Usage :There are seperate platform to learn ,practice, analyze ourselves and also there are platform for conducting online tests but there is no single platform where
both the work can be done. Also want to create a platform that can guide students in their life earlier so that they can set their goal very early which is not the case with many students.
Also, we have further thought to improvise as we move ahead with this project.

Support: We have provided chatbot,contact-form and address. So. If any one come up with suggestion it will be a great gesture 
	And we will positivelt look into it.

RoadMap: As of now we will accept the questions from the teacher in a word document format and code it in the form of a test and 
	this process we will automate in upcoming updates and then we will accept the answer of all the students and then return the complete database back to the teacher for evaluation.

Contributors: We are making it as an open source so that our users can suggest any minor/major changes as per their requirements ,We will review there contribution and merge it in our project.

Team Acknowledgement: Jaspreet Singh , Priyesh Pandey, Piyush Nagpal, Prakhar Sharma.

Project Status: Consist of Profile page,Discuss page ,Resources page,Career page,Contest page and We have just made a sample test and practice section because of time limit but we have a vision to make such a section that teacher can organize a test on it and 
also able to track the students progress.
